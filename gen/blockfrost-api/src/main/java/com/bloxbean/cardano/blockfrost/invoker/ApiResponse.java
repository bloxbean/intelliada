 * Blockfrost.io ~ API Documentation
 * Blockfrost is an API as a service that allows users to interact with the Cardano blockchain and parts of its ecosystem.  ## Authentication  After signing up on https://blockfrost.io, a `project_id` token is automatically generated for each project. HTTP header of your request MUST include this `project_id` in order to authenticate against Blockfrost servers.  ## Available networks  At the moment, you can use the following networks. Please, note that each network has its own `project_id`.  <table>   <tr><td><b>Network</b></td><td><b>Endpoint</b></td></tr>   <tr><td>Cardano mainnet</td><td><tt>https://cardano-mainnet.blockfrost.io/api/v0</td></tt></tr>   <tr><td>Cardano testnet</td><td><tt>https://cardano-testnet.blockfrost.io/api/v0</tt></td></tr>   <tr><td>InterPlanetary File System</td><td><tt>https://ipfs.blockfrost.io/api/v0</tt></td></tr> </table>  ## Concepts  * All endpoints return either a JSON object or an array. * Data is returned in *ascending* (oldest first, newest last) order.   * You might use the `?order=desc` query parameter to reverse this order. * By default, we return 100 results at a time. You have to use `?page=2` to list through the results. * All time and timestamp related fields are in milliseconds of UNIX time. * All amounts are returned in Lovelaces, where 1 ADA = 1 000 000 Lovelaces. * Addresses, accounts and pool IDs are in Bech32 format. * All values are case sensitive. * All hex encoded values are lower case. * Examples are not based on real data. Any resemblance to actual events is purely coincidental. * We allow to upload files up to 100MB of size to IPFS. This might increase in the future.  ## Errors  ### HTTP Status codes  The following are HTTP status code your application might receive when reaching Blockfrost endpoints and it should handle all of these cases.  * HTTP `400` return code is used when the request is not valid. * HTTP `402` return code is used when the projects exceed their daily request limit. * HTTP `403` return code is used when the request is not authenticated. * HTTP `404` return code is used when the resource doesn't exist. * HTTP `418` return code is used when the user has been auto-banned for flooding too much after previously receiving error code `402` or `429`. * HTTP `429` return code is used when the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time and therefore has been rate-limited. * HTTP `500` return code is used when our endpoints are having a problem.  ### Error codes  An internal error code number is used for better indication of the error in question. It is passed using the following payload.  ```json {   \"status_code\": 403,   \"error\": \"Forbidden\",   \"message\": \"Invalid project token.\" } ``` ## Limits   There are two types of limits we are enforcing. The first depends on your plan and is the number of request we allow per day. We defined  the day from midnight to midnight of UTC time. The second is rate limiting, where we limit an end user to 10 requests per second after a period  of 5 second burst. We believe this should be sufficient for most of the use cases. If it is not and you have a specific use case, please get in touch with us, and  we will make sure to take it into account as much as we can.  # Authentication  <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->
